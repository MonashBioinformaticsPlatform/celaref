Title: Single-cell RNAseq cell cluster labelling by reference
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Sarah", "Williams", email = "sarah.williams1@monash.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: After the clustering step of a single-cell RNAseq experiment, this
  package aims to suggest labels/cell types for the clusters, on the basis of 
  similarity to a reference dataset. It requires a table of read counts per 
  cell per gene, and a list of the cells belonging to each of the clusters, 
  (for both test and reference data).
