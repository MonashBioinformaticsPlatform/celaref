In their paper 'Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq' Zeisel et al. (2015) performed single cell RNA sequencing in mouse, in two tissues (sscortex and ca1hippocampus).

This data was download from the link provided in the paper: http://linnarssonlab.org/cortex


Specfically, both counts and cell annotations were parsed from this file:
mRNA : https://storage.googleapis.com/linnarsson-lab-www-blobs/blobs/cortex/expression_mRNA_17-Aug-2014.txt
NB: The cell info/experimental details were parsed out of the first 10 lines of this file manually. The rest is counts data.
