Farmer et al. (2017) have published a survey of cell types in the mouse lacrimal gland at two developmental stages. 


For the two datasets 'barcodes', 'genes' and 'matrix' files were downloaded form the GEO repository via accession codes GSM2671415 (E16) and GSM2671416 (P4). These were processed as described in the vignette.

Cell and cluster information were downloaded from the supplementary information (Tables S9, S10, S11 and S12) and formatted manually.
