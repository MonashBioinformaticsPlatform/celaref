abstract = {The tear producing lacrimal gland is a tubular organ that protects and lubricates the ocular surface. While the lacrimal gland possesses many features that make it an excellent model to understand tubulogenesis, the cell types and lineage relationships that drive lacrimal gland formation are unclear. Using single cell sequencing and other molecular tools, we reveal novel cell identities and epithelial lineage dynamics that underlie lacrimal gland development. We show that the lacrimal gland from its earliest developmental stages is composed of multiple subpopulations of immune, epithelial, and mesenchymal cell lineages. The epithelial lineage exhibits the most substantiative cellular changes, transitioning through a series of unique transcriptional states to become terminally differentiated acinar, ductal and myoepithelial cells. Furthermore, lineage tracing in postnatal and adult glands provides the first direct evidence of unipotent KRT5+ epithelial cells in the lacrimal gland. Finally, we show conservation of developmental markers between the developing mouse and human lacrimal gland, supporting the use of mice to understand human development. Together, our data reveal critical features of lacrimal gland development that have broad implications for understanding epithelial organogenesis.},

abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression heterogeneity but suffers from stochastic dropout and characteristic bimodal expression distributions in which expression is either strongly non-zero or non-detectable. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model for such bimodal data that parameterizes both of these features. We argue that the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes expressed in a cell, should be adjusted for as a source of nuisance variation. Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment.

abstract = {The commercially available 10X Genomics protocol to generate droplet-based single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is enjoying growing popularity among researchers. Fundamental to the analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method offers most accuracy. Answering this question is complicated by the fact that 10X Genomics data lack cell labels that would allow a direct performance evaluation. Thus in this review, we focused on comparing clustering solutions of a dozen methods for three datasets on human peripheral mononuclear cells generated with the 10X Genomics technology. While clustering solutions appeared robust, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other. They also failed to replicate cell type assignment generated with supervised labeling approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all clustering methods tested clustered cells to a large degree according to the amount of ribosomal RNA in each cell.},

Here we present Haemopedia, an atlas of murine gene-expression data containing 54 hematopoietic cell types, covering all the mature lineages in hematopoiesis. We include rare cell populations such as eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and megakaryocytes, and a broad collection of progenitor and stem cells. We show that lineage branching and maturation during hematopoiesis can be reconstructed using the expression patterns of small sets of genes. We also have identified genes with enriched expression in each of the mature blood cell lineages, many of which show conserved lineage-enriched expression in human hematopoiesis. We have created an online web portal called Haemosphere to make analyses of Haemopedia and other blood cell transcriptional datasets easier. This resource provides simple tools to interrogate gene-expression-based relationships between hematopoietic cell types and genes of interest.},

RNA staining methods assay only a small number of transcripts, whereas single-cell RNA-seq, which measures global gene expression, separates cells from their native spatial context. Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.},

abstract = {Hematopoiesis is a carefully controlled process that is regulated by complex networks of transcription factors that are, in part, controlled by signals resulting from ligand binding to cell-surface receptors. To further understand hematopoiesis, we have compared gene expression profiles of human erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, B cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes, and monocytes using whole genome microarrays. A bioinformatics analysis of these data was performed focusing on transcription factors, immunoglobulin superfamily members, and lineage-specific transcripts. We observed that the numbers of lineage-specific genes varies by 2 orders of magnitude, ranging from 5 for cytotoxic T cells to 878 for granulocytes. In addition, we have identified novel coexpression patterns for key transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis (eg, GATA3-GFI1 and GATA2-KLF1). This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of gene expression in hematopoietic cells to date and has identified genes that play key roles in lineage commitment and cell function. The data, which are freely accessible, will be invaluable for future studies on hematopoiesis and the role of specific genes and will also aid the understanding of the recent genome-wide association studies.},

We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.},
